Our project simulates an n-tuple pendulum with varying dampers and starting positions. 
We will use simple Lagrangian Mechanics to model the physical system, and allow the user
to select the number of pendulums that are connected together. One visual will be the
evolution of the physical system with time, given a user-inputted initial position.
Another will be a graph that shows the evolution of the velocities of each bob with time.

The MVC model is appropriate for this project as we have a clearly defined model (the n-tuple
pendulum) that is visualized virtually. The user can manipulate parameters of the model with
some controls, which in turn modifies the visual. This allows for a "core" model,
that is flexible to user-inputted adaptations and tweaks.
